cdgplay

Simple cdg file player. Drag and drop a sub file or cdg file onto it to play.
Default is full-speed playback with no delay. When using from command line, you can add a speed parameter to play at a specified rate.

cdgfix
------

Fix errors in sub or cdg files. Most cdg files read from CD do not have error correction performed. This will cause color blocks and screen artifacts during playback.
Drag and drop the file onto it to perform error correction and automatically save. It will display the number of corrected blocks and the number of uncorrectable blocks.
