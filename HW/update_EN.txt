SAROO V1.2


1. Replaced MCU with STM32H750VBT6.
     Faster speed: 200/400Mhz
     More RAM: 1024KB
       RAM can be used as SD card data cache

2. Added USB OTG device support.

3. BUGFIX:
     Added FSMC ADV signal.
     Fixed XC6206 packaging.

4. Added a reset button for easier debugging.

5. STM32 added a SPI FLASH.

6. AWAIT signal added tri-state driver.

7. FPGA added a SPI PSRAM.


SAROO V1.3

1. SD card signals added pull-up resistors

2. FPGA_DONE signal added pull-up resistor

3. Saturn cartridge slot removed SPCLK, and added AA24
